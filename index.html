<h1>Privacy Policy – Notifications Recovery (GDPR-compliant)</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 09 April 2023<br>
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> 21 June 2025</p>

<p>AlfTenDev built the <strong>Notifications Recovery</strong> app as an Open Source application. This service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to inform users about the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data in compliance with the <strong>EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>.</p>

<h2>🔍 Data Controller</h2>

<p><em>Note: Notification data is <strong>stored only on your device</strong> and is never transmitted to me.</em></p>

<h2>🍪 Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>While the app does not use cookies directly, <strong>third-party libraries or SDKs</strong> (such as Firebase Crashlytics or Google Play Services) may use tracking technologies.</p>
<p>Where required by law, I will request your <strong>explicit consent</strong> before such technologies are activated.</p>
<p>You can manage or withdraw your consent at any time via your device settings.</p>

<h2>👨‍👩‍👧 Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>This app is not directed to children under <strong>16 years of age</strong>.<br>
I do not knowingly collect personal information from children, and the app does not transmit or store any personal data externally. All data remains on the user's device.</p>
<p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the app, please note that any data can be deleted directly from the device within the app settings. I do not have access to any user data and therefore cannot delete it remotely.</p>

<h2>🔐 Data Security</h2>
<p>I use commercially reasonable measures to protect your information. However, please be aware that <strong>no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure</strong>.</p>

<h2>🌍 International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>I may use service providers (e.g. Google, Firebase) located <strong>outside the European Economic Area (EEA)</strong>.<br>
In such cases, I ensure that data transfers are protected by <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses</strong> or equivalent safeguards as required by the GDPR.</p>

<h2>📬 Your GDPR Rights</h2>
<p>As an EU/EEA user, you have the right to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Access your personal data</li>
    <li>Request correction or deletion</li>
    <li>Restrict or object to processing</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent (at any time, where processing is based on consent)</li>
    <li>Request data portability</li>
    <li>Lodge a complaint with your national Data Protection Authority</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, you can contact me at <a href="mailto:alftendev@gmail.com">alftendev@gmail.com</a>. Please note that certain rights—such as viewing, deleting, or exporting your data—can also be exercised directly within the app via the Settings.</p>

<h2>🔗 Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites.</p>
<p>I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

<h2>📌 Third-Party App Icons</h2>
<p>This app may display the icons of third-party applications installed on your device, solely for the purpose of identifying apps listed in the blacklist, whitelist or as part of the service’s core functionality.</p>
<p>All trademarks, app names, logos, and icons displayed are the property of their respective owners. Their appearance within this app is used strictly for identification and functional purposes, and does not imply any affiliation, endorsement, or sponsorship by the respective trademark holders.</p>
<p>The icons are accessed locally from the Android system and are not modified, transmitted, or stored externally by the app.</p>

<h2>🔁 Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>I may update this policy from time to time.<br>
Changes will be posted here and indicated by the “Last Updated” date.</p>
